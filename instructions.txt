NEET Testline Project - Detailed Instructions
=============================================

1. Clone the Repository:
   ------------------------
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neet-testline-project.git
       cd neet-testline-project

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
   ---------------------------------------------
   It is best practice to isolate project dependencies.
   
   On macOS/Linux:
       python -m venv venv
       source venv/bin/activate
       
   On Windows:
       python -m venv venv
       venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install the Required Packages:
   ---------------------------------
   Install all dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:
       pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Replace the NEET Dataset (for Improved Predictions):
   ------------------------------------------------------
   - The file `actual_neet_data.csv` contains sample NEET data for demonstration.
   - To make robust predictions, replace this file with your actual NEET dataset.
   - Your actual dataset should include the following columns:
         * historical_accuracy (e.g., historical quiz accuracy percentage)
         * current_accuracy (e.g., current quiz accuracy percentage)
         * total_quizzes (e.g., total number of quizzes taken)
         * weak_topics_count (e.g., number of topics with weak performance)
         * neet_rank (the actual NEET rank)
   - Ensure the CSV file is placed in the project root with the same name: actual_neet_data.csv

5. Running the Project:
   -----------------------
   You can run the project either via the Jupyter Notebook or by executing Python scripts.
   
   Option A: Using Jupyter Notebook
       - Launch the notebook:
             jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
       - Run all cells sequentially to:
             * Fetch and load current quiz, submission, and historical data.
             * Process and analyze the data.
             * Generate insights and recommendations.
             * Execute bonus analysis (student persona and NEET rank prediction).
             * Generate and view visualizations.
   
   Option B: Using Python Scripts
       - Run the data analysis script:
             python data_fetch_and_analysis.py
       - (Optional) Run the NEET rank model script:
             python neet_rank_model.py

6. Understanding the Flow of the Program:
   ----------------------------------------
   - **Data Ingestion:**  
     The project fetches current quiz data from a live API, loads quiz submission data from a local JSON file, and fetches historical quiz data from another API.
     
   - **Data Processing:**  
     The raw data is normalized into DataFrames. The historical data is processed to extract topics and convert accuracy percentages to floats.
     
   - **Analysis & Insights:**  
     Current quiz performance is compared to historical performance to compute accuracy metrics. Weak topics are identified, and insights are generated to recommend areas for improvement.
     
   - **Bonus Analysis:**  
     A student persona is assigned based on performance thresholds, and a naive NEET rank prediction is performed using a pre-trained model (or a placeholder model). The predictions are based on features such as historical accuracy, current accuracy, total quizzes, and weak topic count.
     
   - **Visualization:**  
     Visualizations are generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn to display key performance metrics and insights.
     
7. Demo Materials:
   ----------------
   - **Screenshots:**  
     Refer to the `screenshots` folder for images of key visualizations and insights.
   - **Demo Video:**  
     A short demo video (`demo_video.mp4`) is provided to demonstrate the workflow, sample inputs/outputs, and a brief explanation of the logic and recommendations.
   
8. Future Enhancements & Customization:
   --------------------------------------
   - With your actual NEET data in place, you can further improve the predictive model by:
         * Implementing advanced feature engineering.
         * Performing hyperparameter tuning using grid search or randomized search.
         * Experimenting with alternative models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, neural networks).
         * Deploying the model as a RESTful API for real-time predictions.
   - These enhancements will further refine the predictions and insights, making the system more robust and production-ready.
   
9. Troubleshooting:
   ------------------
   - Ensure that your virtual environment is activated before installing packages or running the scripts.
   - Confirm that the `actual_neet_data.csv` file is in the correct location and formatted as expected.
   - Check the terminal/log outputs for any errors or warnings. Refer to the code comments and documentation for guidance.
   
10. Contribution and Feedback:
    ----------------------------
    - Feel free to fork the repository and suggest improvements.
    - Contributions to further enhance the analysis, model performance, and visualizations are welcome.

Enjoy working on the NEET Testline project and best of luck with your contributions!
